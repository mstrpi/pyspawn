# pyspawn
just attempting to convert [my nspawn install in bash](https://github.com/mstrpi/nspawn) scripts to python as I learn.\
\
I kept losing current version somehow (my own space cadet-ness). So at least it's here in a central location.\
\
still very much a work in progress. as always, feedback is welcome. thanks for the time and thoughts.
